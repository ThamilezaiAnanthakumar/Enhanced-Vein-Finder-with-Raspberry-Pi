# 🎯 Real-Time Image Processing using Raspberry Pi + NoIR Camera + Custom LED PCB

This project presents a complete real-time image acquisition and processing pipeline using a **Raspberry Pi**, **Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera**, and a **custom-designed LED array PCB** for controlled lighting. It uses advanced image processing techniques like **CLAHE**, **adaptive thresholding**, **Otsu’s method**, **morphological operations**, and **contour detection** to highlight areas of interest in grayscale images.

Originally based on an ESP32-CAM project, this upgraded system offers more flexibility, accuracy, and image quality.
