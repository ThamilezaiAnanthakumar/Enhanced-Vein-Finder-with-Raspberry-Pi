# Real-Time Image Processing using Raspberry Pi + NoIR Camera + Custom LED PCB

This project is a complete real-time image capturing and processing system using a Raspberry Pi, a Raspberry Pi NoIR Camera, and a custom-made LED light board for better lighting control. It uses advanced image processing methods such as CLAHE, adaptive thresholding, Otsu’s method, morphological operations, and contour detection to clearly highlight important areas in grayscale images.

At first, this was based on a simpler ESP32-CAM project we did in Semester 2. But after learning more about image processing and computer vision, I decided to improve it using what I had studied. This upgraded system gives better image quality, flexibility, and accuracy. The processed video is shown live on a website that can be viewed on any device connected to the same network as the Raspberry Pi.

In the future, I plan to improve the website to make it more responsive and secure. This system can be used as a real-time screen for nurses to clearly see veins and help guide needle placement more accurately.

## 🔬 Image Processing Pipeline

1. **Image preprocessing includes CLAHE (Contrast Limited Adaptive Histogram Equalization) for enhanced contrast**  
2. **Median and Gaussian Blur filters applied for noise suppression.**
3. **Adaptive Thresholding (Mean) and Otsu’s Thresholding used to segment vein patterns.**
4. **Morphological Opening performed to remove small artifacts and improve structure clarity**
5. **Contour Detection and Overlay used to highlight vein boundaries.**
6. **Enhanced version includes continuous real-time video output with focused vein visualization on screen for monitoring.**
