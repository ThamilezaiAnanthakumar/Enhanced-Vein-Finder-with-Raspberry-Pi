# Extended-Version-of-Vein-Finder-Using-Raspberry-Pi
This project uses a Raspberry Pi with a NoIR camera and a custom LED array PCB to perform real-time grayscale image enhancement and object detection. It applies CLAHE, thresholding, and contour detection using OpenCV, enabling accurate segmentation under controlled lighting ; ideal for low-light or biomedical imaging applications.
